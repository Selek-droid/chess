Hi mom,

The notaire has sent to your email a document for you.  You shouldn't try to print it or sign it; I just want to make sure you received it.  Can you check your inbox and spam folder for it?  It would be from office.frappatetassocies-loches, or the assistant to the notaire, Anne-sylvaine Boyault, or the notaire herself, Maud Frappat.

Also, for our videoconference (this coming Tuesday at noon), you need to install the app "LifeSize".  If you laptop has a webcam, then I'd install it on the laptop.  Wherever you install it, you'll need that device to have a webcam. 

Love,

Geoff
